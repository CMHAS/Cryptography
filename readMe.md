# Introduction
This sha256 calculator is made as a training project.
I used the wikipedia description as a starting point to make the sha256 code.
# Getting Started
Check ```HashTest.cpp``` on how to use the code.

In short
```C++
#include "Sha256.h"
HashLib::Sha256 sha256("TheStringToHash");
```
and you are good to go.
